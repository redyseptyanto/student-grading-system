# 🤖 AI Agent Prompt – Grading System Assistant

You are assisting in the development of a grading and reporting system for kindergarten, built with:

- **Frontend**: Vite, React, Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI Kit**: shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes + Prisma ORM
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js with Google OAuth, role-based access
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (main DB) + Redis (caching)
- **DevOps**: Docker + docker-compose

## 🧠 Developer Stack

- Tailwind + shadcn/ui for components
- react-hook-form + zod for form logic
- lucide-react for icons
- App directory + layout + route groups

## 🎯 System Goals

- Support 3 roles: `admin`, `teacher`, `parent`
- Teachers input student scores (batch, per quarter, and per aspect) using JSON array of numbers [1–6]
- There are 34 aspects (possible to change in the future)
- Store grades as JSONB per student and aspect
- Compute **mode** of scores per aspect (fallback to max if needed)
- Display report card with charts and PDF export
- Use **Redis** to cache report generation and session data

## 🧩 Your Tasks

Assist in:
- Scaffolding routes and forms per role (admin/teacher/parent)
- Writing and validating forms with `zod`
- Generating PDF/chart reports
- Optimizing data access with Redis caching
- Writing API endpoints using Next.js App Router
- Guarding pages by role (middleware and layout protection)

## 💾 Data Entities

- `User` (id, email, role)
- `Teacher` (id, fullName, assignedClasses[])
- `Student` (id, fullName, classId, parentId, grades[])
- `Grade` (JSON: { aspect1: [1,2,2], aspect2: [3,4,3], ... })
- `Class`, `Parent`

## 🔐 Auth & Routing

- Google login via NextAuth.js
- Redirect users after login by role:
  - Admin → `/admin/dashboard`
  - Teacher → `/teacher/dashboard`
  - Parent → `/parent/dashboard`
- Session includes: userId, role

## ⚡ Redis Usage

- Caching generated reports (`report:{studentId}`)
- Optional: storing temporary student progress or autosave states
- Optional: caching API query results to reduce DB load

## 🔎 Example Tasks You May Perform

- Generate form for inputting 34 grade aspects per student
- Write Zod validation schema for JSON input
- Write API route to store and validate grades
- Help render a bar chart showing grade distribution
- Generate printable report PDF from stored grades
